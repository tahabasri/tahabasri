### Hi there, I'm Taha BASRI ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for turning complex problems into elegant solutions. With a background as diverse as my Spotify playlist, I've journeyed from crafting Java applications to sculpting SaaS masterpieces with Salesforce.

At CGI, I was like a wizard in the world of Java, bringing up enhancements and features for enterprise applications. Then, I joined team Oracle (like team Red Bull Racing did), where I helped automate processes faster than you can say "GraalVM".

Now, as a Technical Consultant at Salesforce, I'm like a digital architect, designing and delivering tailored solutions using Salesforce's finest tools. Whether it's Experience Cloud, Commerce Cloud, or Lightning Web Components, I'm your go-to guru for all things Salesforce.

Whether it's a chat about your next big idea or a request for some coding magic, I'm here to turn your tech dreams into reality, one line of code at a time. âœ¨
